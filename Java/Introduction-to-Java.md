# Day 218 – Introduction to Programming & Java

## What is Programming?
Programming is the process of giving instructions to a computer to perform specific tasks.  
It tells the computer exactly **what to do and how to do it** in a step-by-step manner.

### Why Programming is Needed
- To solve problems efficiently using computers.
- To automate repetitive tasks.
- To create software, apps, websites, and games.
- To communicate instructions to machines that do not understand human language.

## What is a Programming Language?
A programming language is a **special language that humans can use to communicate with computers**.  
It provides a set of rules and syntax to write programs that computers can understand.

# Introduction to Java

## What is Java?
Java is a **high-level, object-oriented programming language** used to build a wide variety of applications, from desktop and mobile apps to large-scale enterprise systems.

---

## History of Java
- Java was first created by **James Gosling** at Sun Microsystems in 1991.  
- Initially, it was named **Oak**, inspired by an oak tree outside the creator’s office.  
- Later, the name was changed to **Java**, inspired by coffee.  
- The **iconic coffee cup logo** represents this connection.

## Fun Facts About Java
- Java is **platform-independent**: Write once, run anywhere.  
- It is one of the **most popular programming languages** in the world.  
- Used in **Android apps, web development, cloud computing, banking systems**, and more.  
- Java runs on the **Java Virtual Machine (JVM)**, which allows the same program to run on multiple devices.

---

## Advantages of Java
- **Easy to learn and use** for beginners.  
- **Object-oriented**, making code modular and reusable.  
- **Platform-independent** – works on different operating systems without modification.  
- **Secure** – has built-in security features.  
- **Rich API** – provides many libraries for building applications quickly.

---

## Disadvantages of Java
- Slower than languages like C or C++ due to JVM overhead.  
- Requires more **memory** compared to some other languages.  
- GUI development (desktop applications) is considered less flexible compared to modern frameworks.  
- Verbose syntax – sometimes requires writing more code for simple tasks.

---

## Key Takeaways
- Programming is a way to communicate with computers to solve problems.  
- Java is beginner-friendly, versatile, and widely used in industry.  
---
## Plan for Tomorrow
- Learn **Variables and Data Types in Java**.  
- Write the first simple Java program: `Hello World`.
