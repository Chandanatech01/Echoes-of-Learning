# Welcome to My Learning Repository 🚀

Hi! I’m Chandana. I started sharing my placement preparation journey on LinkedIn under the name **"Echoes of Chandana"**, where I post my daily learnings, challenges, and progress.  

To make my learning more structured and publicly accessible, I decided to create this GitHub repository. Here, I document my **Java Full Stack** and **Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA)** journey from absolute basics.  

This repository contains:

- **Java Folder:** Daily notes, explanations, and examples as I learn Java Full Stack.  
- **DSA Folder:** Daily notes, examples, and explanations to understand algorithms and time complexities step by step.  

---

## Why This Repository Exists
- To **learn consistently** every day and track progress.  
- To **document concepts in a simple and clear way** for myself and for others.  
- To **help beginners** who want to start learning programming and DSA.  
- To **stay accountable** and build a visual record of my journey.  
- To **grow my GitHub contributions** while sharing knowledge publicly.  

---

## My Current Focus
As of **Day 218**, I have decided to start learning **Java Full Stack** and **DSA** from scratch.  
- Today, I covered the **basics of programming and introduction to Java**.  
- In DSA, I learned about **different time complexities** with simple, real-world examples.  

Every day I will add new notes, examples, and explanations in their respective folders to keep everything organized and easy to follow.
